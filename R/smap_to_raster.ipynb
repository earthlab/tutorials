    "The National Snow and Ice Data Center hosts soil moisture data (from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive project, described [here](https://nsidc.org/data/smap), and hereafter referred to as SMAP) which is provided in .h5 format. HDF5 is a \"hierarchical\" data format, with multiple groups and datasets (further explained in Step 2) which are useful for storing and organizing large amounts of data. While this format is great for the large amount of data being collected, we often want to utilize a single dataset within the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to access SMAP data, and how to generate raster output from an HDF5 file. A raster is a two dimensional array, with each element in the array containing a specific value. In this case, the two dimensions correspond to longitude and latitude, and the elements or values represent soil moisture."
