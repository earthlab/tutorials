    "The National Snow and Ice Data Center hosts soil moisture data (from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive project, described [here](https://nsidc.org/data/smap), and hereafter referred to as SMAP) which is provided in .h5 format. HDF5 is a \"hierarchical\" data format, with multiple groups and datasets (further explained in Step 2) which are useful for storing and organizing large amounts of data. While this format is great for the large amount of data being collected, we often want to utilize a single dataset within the file.\n",
