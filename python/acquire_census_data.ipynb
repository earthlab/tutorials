    "## About \n",
    "There are several useful online sources for accessing census data provided both by the US census Bureau ([American Factfinder](http://factfinder.census.gov)), and outside sources. These sources, however, are not conducive to large scale data aquisition and analysis. The [Cenpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cenpy/0.9.1) python package allows for programmitic access of this data through the [Census Bureau's API](http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial outlines the use of the Cenpy package to search for, and acquire specific census data. Cenpy saves this data as a [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframe. These dataframes allow for easy access and analysis of data within python. For easy visualization of this data look into the [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) package. This package builds on the base Pandas package to add tools for geospatial data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Install Cenpy package\n",
    "- Search for desired census data\n",
    "- Download and store data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies \n",
    "The Cenpy package depends on pandas and [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). Ensure that python and pip are already properly installed then use the following commands to install cenpy."

       "{'2012 American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates': \"The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.  Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself.  The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1-year, 3-year and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups.  Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.  For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.\"}"

It is also useful to add on the `NAME` and `GEOID` columns, as these will provide the name and geographic id of all data. In this example, we will use the [B01001A](https://www.socialexplorer.com/data/ACS2013/metadata/?ds=ACS13&table=B01001A), which gives data for sex by age within the desired geography.
